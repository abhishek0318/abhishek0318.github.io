Hi! I am Abhishek. I am pursuing Master of Technology in [Mathematics and Computing](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/mat/courses/idd){:target="\_blank"} at the [Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varansi](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/){:target="\_blank"}. I am excited about using the latest technology to build impactful products and solutions. For the last few years, I have been broadly working on Machine Learning with particular focus on Natural Language Processing and Reinforcement Learning.  

Currently, I am working with [Prof. K. Lakshamanan](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/cse/people/lakshmanankcse){:target="\_blank"} on theoretical Reinforcement Learning developing model-based regret-free algorithms. I am also enthusiastic about using ML algorithms to solve high impact real-world problems. This summer, I worked with the Maps Intelligence team at Uber building machine learning systems to automatically triage driver reported map tickets. 

I have a particular liking for Natural Language Processing, specifically Conversational AI. Last summer, I worked with [Danish Contractor](https://sites.google.com/site/danishcontractor1/home){:target="\_blank"} of the Dialogue Team at [IBM Research Delhi](https://www.research.ibm.com/labs/india/){:target="\_blank"} on conversational question answering. During this project, we also investigated the robustness of the state of the art NLP models. Prior to that, I spent a summer at [MT-NLP Lab](https://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/nlpmt/){:target="\_blank"}, IIIT Hyderabad working on Morphological Inflection for the Low Resource setting.
