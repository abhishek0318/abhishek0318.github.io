Hi! I am Abhishek. I am currently pursuing Bachelors and Masters in Technology in [Mathematics and Computing](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/mat/courses/idd){:target="\_blank"} at [Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varansi](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/){:target="\_blank"}. I am an aspiring researcher. My research interests lie in Natural Language Processing and Reinforcement Learning.  

I am currently working with [Prof. K. Lakshamanan](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/cse/people/lakshmanankcse){:target="\_blank"}, developing model-based regret-free Reinforcement Learning algorithms. Last summer, I worked with [Danish Contractor](https://sites.google.com/site/danishcontractor1/home){:target="\_blank"} and [Sachindra Joshi](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=in-jsachind){:target="\_blank"} at [IBM Research Delhi](https://www.research.ibm.com/labs/india/){:target="\_blank"} on conversational question answering. Prior to that, I spent a summer at [MT-NLP Lab](https://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/nlpmt/){:target="\_blank"}, IIIT Hyderabad working on Morphological Inflection.
